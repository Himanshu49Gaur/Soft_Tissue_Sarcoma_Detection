# Soft Tissue Sarcoma Detection using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)

## 1. Introduction
Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS) refers to a diverse group of malignant tumors arising from connective tissues such as muscles, fat, nerves, and blood vessels. Accurate diagnosis and classification of STS are critical for effective treatment planning, yet conventional diagnostic approaches are largely manual and subjective.

This project presents a **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)**-based framework for automated detection and classification of soft tissue sarcoma. By representing feature interactions as graph structures, the system captures spatial and relational dependencies that traditional deep learning models often overlook. The final model classifies tissue states into three categories:

- Non-Tumor  
- Non-Viable Tumor  
- Viable Tumor  

The proposed pipeline combines data preprocessing, hybrid feature extraction, graph construction, and graph-based deep learning to improve the accuracy and interpretability of STS classification.

## 2. Objectives
- Construct a robust end-to-end pipeline for soft tissue sarcoma detection using graph-based learning.  
- Employ Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for capturing non-linear dependencies among tissue features.  
- Analyze the performance of the proposed model using standard evaluation metrics and visualization tools.
