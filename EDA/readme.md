# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 1. Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial phase of this project aimed at understanding the structure, distribution, and intrinsic properties of the **Soft Tissue Sarcoma** dataset before applying any machine learning or deep learning techniques.  
EDA helps identify patterns, detect anomalies, and ensure the dataset is balanced, clean, and suitable for model training.

The EDA conducted in this section provided insights into **data quality, class distribution, feature variability, and normalization requirements**, all of which guided the model architecture design.
