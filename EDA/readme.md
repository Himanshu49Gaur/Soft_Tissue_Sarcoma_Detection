# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 1. Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial phase of this project aimed at understanding the structure, distribution, and intrinsic properties of the **Soft Tissue Sarcoma** dataset before applying any machine learning or deep learning techniques.  
EDA helps identify patterns, detect anomalies, and ensure the dataset is balanced, clean, and suitable for model training.

The EDA conducted in this section provided insights into **data quality, class distribution, feature variability, and normalization requirements**, all of which guided the model architecture design.

## 2. Objectives of EDA

1. **Understand Dataset Composition** – Determine the number of images, their dimensions, and class distribution across training, validation, and test sets.  
2. **Assess Class Balance** – Identify if the dataset is imbalanced and perform augmentation or sampling where necessary.  
3. **Visualize Data Distribution** – Generate visual summaries to understand pixel intensity, color channels, and feature variation.  
4. **Detect Anomalies or Noise** – Identify corrupted or misclassified samples through visualization and statistical metrics.  
5. **Guide Preprocessing Decisions** – Provide a data-driven foundation for normalization, augmentation, and feature extraction strategies.
